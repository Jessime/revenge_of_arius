# Revenge of Arius (Summer, 2014)

My first coding project.

## Install

Install at this point is:

```
brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi
pip install pygame
```

The brew command was taken from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41806977/cant-install-pygame-with-pip-as-there-is-an-error-whilst-runningvsetup-py-bdist)

Launch with:

```
python Arius.py
```
